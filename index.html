    <h2>My Project</h2>

    <p>
      In our Year 10 Digital Technology class, we built games for people to play at the Year 10 Market Day. My project
      was Balloon pop
    </p>

    <p>
      Balloon Pop is a game where you have darts and you balloons and you pay to try pop the balloons. There is a
      mirco bit that when it heres a pop noice it lit up on the micro bit. there is a person on the sides spinning a
      peice of rope to make the balloons move around so it wasnt to easy to pop the balloons.</p>
    </p>

    <p>
      Balloon Pop had some problems along the way of the process trying to make it. One of the problems we have
      was how to get the balloon going around without it falling of or getting stuck when it goes around the corner.
      We stopped this problem by making sure there was more room for the balloon when it went around the corner by using
      an extender.

      For the coding for Balloon Pop we used a microbit. The microbit picked up the sound of the balloon popping.
      It sended a radio signal to another micobit that Eva was holding. The microbit would only pick up sound if it was
      above the sound level 70. This wasnt a easy task if the sound level was to low it would pick up everything but if
      it was to high it wouldnt pick up anything. To make sure we had theperfect sound level we would clap as loud as a
      balloon would pop next to the microbit.

      For the building side of Balloon Pop we used an EPro8 kit to build the base of our game. We all had a seperate
      jobs Eva
      was the builder and Annabel was the ideas girl and I was the designer that designed all the logos and prices. Once
      we had all
      the building part was over and we had printed out all our logos we sent it down to the office to get it laminated.
      Then we stuck
      it on the Balloon Pop base. Annabel and I was went down to the gym to go find a dart board to hope that there is
      darts in it there
      none. We asked Mr Hullen to get us some darts and balloons and he did. While we waited for them we thought we need
      something to be
      at the back of the target so the dart sticks. Our group went down to the skip and found some old card board. We
      trimmed it down to
      the size we needed it to be. Once the darts and balloons arrived we blew up some balloons and stuck it on to
      Balloon
      Pop string it
      keeped falling of Annabel decided to put on rubber bands before stuck the balloons on so we could tie them on to
      the
      rubber bands.
      It ended up working very good.
