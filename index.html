    <h2>My Project</h2>
    <p>In our Year 10 Digital Technology class, we built games for people to play at the Year 10 Market Day. My project was Balloon pop</p>
  </main>
  <p> Balloon pop is a game where you have darts and you balloons and you pay to try pop the balloons. There is a mirco bit that when it heres a pop noice it lit up on the micro bit. there is a person on the sides spinning a peice of rope to make the balloons move around so it wasnt to easy to pop the balloons.</p>
